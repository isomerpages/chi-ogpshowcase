### **How to get onboard**
FormSG is free to access to all TTSH Staff with an Email Address.
* [Login](https://form.gov.sg/login) with your TTSH Email Address, via your clean or dirty laptop.
* Enter OTP code that is being sent to your TTSH Email Address.
* Select "Create form" and your preferred Response Collection Modes to begin creating your form and logic.


### **2 Response Collection Modes**
* **Storage Mode** - View your responses within FormSG. All data is end-to-end encrypted, which means third parties, including FormSG, will not be able to access or view your form data.
	* Create a new Storage mode form and store Secret Key safely.  
Note: Secret Key if lost, will lead to a permanent loss of all responses.
	* Build and share form link with citizens.
	* Upload Secret Key and view your responses.
	* Download your responses as a CSV.
* **Email mode** - Receive your responses at your email address. Form sends responses directly to your email and does not store any response data.
	* Build and publish your form.
	* Collect responses at your TTSH email address.
	* Collate responses with FormSG's [data collation tool.](https://collate.form.gov.sg/)
