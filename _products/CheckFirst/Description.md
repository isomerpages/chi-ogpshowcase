### **A calculator and eligibility builder for the government**

CheckFirst provides an easy way for healthcare staff to build a simple calculator or checker without having to engage vendors to build a customised solution that could be hard to update and change overtime.

*   Provides a form-like experience with added prebuilt logic such as conditional if-else statements
*   Maps a series of constant value to user input for easy computation
*   Allows easy sharing of the checker through a URL or by embedding it on the agencyâ€™s website
