### **How to get onboard**


1.  Create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com/). You can refer to the steps outlined [here](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/)
2.  Send a request through [this contact form](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-contact/).
3.  A template would be generated by Isomer for you
4.  Submit [another form](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-contact/) to gain access to your website and start editing on isomerCMS.

### **Editing your site**

To edit your site, you’ll have to log onto IsomerCMS. Before you do that, make sure that you’ve gotten access to your site. Otherwise, you will not see anything after logging in.

### **Site launch**

Let isomer know in advance (ideally 2 weeks) prior to when you’d like to launch the site. If you need the site to be up urgently, let isomer know when they’re onboarding you onto isomer so they can slot you in their launch schedule quickly.

You can read more about how to launch your website on their [guide](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/).
