### **Reach out to citizens in Minutes**

Postman lets public officers mass send messages to citizens through Telegram, SMS and email via a user interface, with minimal setup required.

* **Multichannel** - No more switching between your Outlook, Messaging app and SMS portal. You can reach your recipients via SMS and email in the same platform.
* **Personalised messages** - Add useful, custom details for your recipients.
* **No more typing +65** - We took care of the country code so you don't have to enter +65 in your Excel file.
* **Send in bulk** - You don't have to BCC everyone and wait for Outlook to slowly send a batch of 1000 emails. Sit back and let Postman do the work for you.
* **Stop your campaign whenever** - You can stop your campaign with a click of a button even when sending is in progress.
* **See past campaigns' stats easily** - You can see summary stats from Postman's campaign landing page for past campaigns.

### **Frequently asked questions**

**What problems are Postman solving?**

* **Communication is manual:** Public officers are still calling and sending individual messages to citizens.
* **Existing tools do not meet users' needs:** Outlook does not support mass sending, as it is capped at 1000 emails at a time.
* **No official source of information:** Citizens currently receive messages from the government via many channels, and consequently are at risk of being phished.

**Is Postman free?**
* Sending an email is free. SMS will be charged based on Twilio's SMS rates.

**Is Postman secure?**

* We recommend that you do not add any sensitive information to the messages. Some of our users generate a recipient specific unique link that opens up to a locked page. 
* When in doubt, you should follow IM8’s guidelines on data classification.
