#### **Project Owners**

This project was helmed by Ms Patricia Chin and team from the Centre of Healthcare Innovation (CHI)'s Partnership and Communications Department. 

#### **Aims of Project**

Set out to **revamp CHI's corporate website**.

Previously, the team had to go through a tedious procurement process to engage new vendors to further develop their website. Thereafter, coordination between the vendors and IHiS had to occur to deploy the changes onto SharePoint. 

Some of the challenges they had were:
* **Old codes.** They did not prefer to re-engage existing vendors to patch existing codes that were very old
* **High costs.**  Vendor procurement costs were too high and not approved by the Finance team due to budget constraints.
* **Slow process.** Sourcing for a new vendor could take up to 6 months. Additionally, changes to the website could take anywhere between 2 days and 6 months, due to the tripartite coordination required (between external vendors, IHiS and the team), and intensive testing undergone to ensure adherence to strict governance requirements.

* **Low satisfaction rate.** Did not see value in sustaining an old website that their users were unhappy with.

#### **Benefits of Isomer**<br>
The revamped CHI website boasts a fresh new look, as shown below.

With Isomer, the team is now empowered to come up with simple codes to build the website themselves, bearing in mind the platform’s code limitations. It has simplified communication revolving around the requirements of the website and reduced coordination between multiple parties.

The team highlighted some of the key benefits of Isomer:

* **New and comprehensible HTML codes.** Minimum codes were required to design the website, hence there was no need to revisit old codes from the existing websites. Marcus, the team’s main technical lead for the website, found Isomer fairly easy to work with, pushing out 1 webpage a day. This was due to his background in HTML programming and accessibility to existing GitHub codes for more advanced website design. Isomer also offers prompt IT support if the team were to encounter issues debugging their codes. He caveated that those without prior experience may face a steep learning curve for complicated web design, though he estimates that time spent learning and developing such a website would take only 1-2 months.

* **Almost zero costs.** Isomer is free-of-charge, and maintenance of the Isomer-built CHI website only includes the domain fee of $50/year and manpower costs. Hence this switch resulted in drastic annual cost savings for the team.

* **Rapid launch of website and easy maintenance.** Content migration from the existing to the new CHI website, supported by an experienced HTML programmer, took only 2 weeks to complete. This was only able to happen because the team was able to bypass the entire vendor procurement process and required little to no complicated programming. Compared to the previous process, 99% of maintenance time has also been saved via Isomer. Simple changes to the new website can be completed within a few hours as the platform enforces strict security policies, doing away the need for additional testing at every juncture.

#### **In A Nutshell** <br>
Isomer streamlines the process of building a secure website, allowing the team to quickly roll out quality content and modifications to meet changing needs. Less time and money are spent coordinating efforts between agencies and ensuring the security of the platform, enabling the team to channel their resources towards designing a better website for their users.
