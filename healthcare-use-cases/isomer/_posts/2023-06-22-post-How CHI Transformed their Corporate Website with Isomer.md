#### **Project Owners**

This project was helmed by Ms Patricia Chin and team from the Centre of Healthcare Innovation (CHI)'s Partnership and Communications Department. 

#### **Aims of Project**

Set out to&nbsp;**revamp CHI's corporate website**&nbsp;as part of their site renewal process.

Previously, the team had to go through a tedious procurement process to engage new vendors to further develop their website. Thereafter, coordination between the vendors and IHiS had to occur to deploy the changes onto SharePoint. 

Some of the challenges they had were:
*   **Old codes.** Did not prefer to re-engage existing vendors to patch old codes.
* **High costs.**  Had to fork out millions of dollars in high vendor procurement costs, project management fees, penetration test costs and SSL certificates payment.
* **Slow procurement process.**  Sourcing for a new vendor could take up to 6 months.
* **Tedious website maintenance.** Changes to the website could take anywhere between 2 days and 6 months, due to the coordination required between different agencies and intensive security testing to ensure adherence to strict governance requirements.



#### **Benefits of Isomer**<br>
With Isomer, the team was empowered to come up with simple codes to build the website themselves, bearing in mind the platformâ€™s code limitations. This process simplified communication revolving around the requirements of the website and reduced coordination between multiple parties

The team highlighted some of the key benefits of Isomer:

* **Simple HTML codes.** Found it relatively easy to build their website using Isomer CMS, with minimal codes required. On average, they were able to design 1 webpage/day. Other key factors that quickened this process was expertise in HTML, access to sample codes on GitHub, and IT support from Isomer.

* **Almost zero costs.** Isomer is free-of-charge, and maintenance of the Isomer-built CHI website only includes the domain fee of $50/year and manpower costs. Hence this switch resulted in drastic annual cost savings for the team.

*  **Rapid launch of website.**&nbsp;Content migration from the existing to the new CHI website, supported by an experienced HTML programmer, took only 2 weeks to complete. This was only able to happen because the team was able to bypass the entire vendor procurement process and required little to no complicated programming.
*  **Easy maintenance.**&nbsp;Compared to the previous process, 99% of maintenance time has also been saved via Isomer. Simple changes to the new website can be completed within a few hours as the platform enforces strict security policies, doing away the need for additional testing at every juncture.

#### **In A Nutshell** <br>
Isomer streamlines the process of building a secure website, allowing the team to quickly roll out quality content and modifications to meet changing needs. Less time and money are spent coordinating efforts between agencies and ensuring the security of the platform, enabling the team to channel their resources towards designing a better website for their users.
