#### **Project Owners**

This project was helmed by Ms Patricia Chin and team from the Centre of Healthcare Innovation (CHI)'s Partnership and Communications Department. 

#### **Aims of Project**

Set out to **revamp CHI's corporate website**.

Previously, the team had to go through a tedious procurement process to engage new vendors to further develop their website. Thereafter, coordination between the vendors and IHiS had to occur to deploy the changes onto SharePoint. 

Some of the challenges they had were:
* **Old codes.** They did not prefer to re-engage existing vendors to patch existing codes that were very old
* **High costs.**  Vendor procurement costs were too high and not approved by the Finance team due to budget constraints.
* **Low satisfaction rate.** Did not see value in sustaining an old website that their users were unhappy with.
* **Exceeded timeline.** Sourcing for a new vendor could take up to 6 months, which exceeded the timeline for the project.

#### **Benefits of Isomer**<br>
The revamped CHI website boasts a fresh new look, as shown below.
